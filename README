to make the test C app, run:

  cd ext
  make -f Makefile_c -B
  ./stata_c_test file.dta

this will compile the application, read file.dta and create a copy of it from the same data in out.dta


to make the test Ruby app, run:

  cd ext
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  ./test.rb file.dta
  
  this will do the same, but using the Ruby extension


If the app finds any issues with the data, it will fail an assert, which will give you line numbers to the source.
