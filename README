to make the test C app, run:

  make -f Makefile_c -B
  ./stata_c_test test_file_1.dta

this will compile the application, read the file test_file_1.dta and create a copy of it from the same data in out.dta


to make the test Ruby app, run:

  ruby extconf.rb
  ./make
  ./test.rb
  
  this will do the same, but testing the file hardcoded in the ruby script (currently test_file_1.dta, test_file_2.dta and test_file_3.dta)


If the app finds any issues with the data, it will fail an assert, which will give you line numbers to the source.
